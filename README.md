# Sampling-Techniques-

## 1. Methodology

The project follows these steps:

Data Collection → Data Preprocessing → Data Balancing → Sampling Techniques → Model Training → Model Evaluation

## 2. Description

- Dataset used: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset  
- Nature of data: Highly imbalanced (fraud vs non-fraud)  
- Dataset is first balanced using undersampling  
- Five different sampling techniques are applied  
- Five machine learning models are trained and tested  
- Model performance is compared using accuracy

**Sampling Techniques Used:**
- Simple Random Sampling  
- Systematic Sampling  
- Stratified Sampling  
- Bootstrap Sampling  
- Cross-Validation Sampling

**Machine Learning Models:**
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 3. Input / Output

**Input:**  
- Credit card transaction features  

**Output:**  
- Fraud or Non-Fraud classification  
- Accuracy comparison table for different sampling techniques and models

## 4. Results and Analysis

- Different sampling techniques give different accuracy values  
- Stratified Sampling and Cross-Validation generally give better results  
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression perform well on balanced data  
- The best sampling technique depends on the model used

## 5. Conclusion

This project shows that sampling techniques play an important role in handling imbalanced datasets.  
Choosing the right sampling method can improve model accuracy and reliability.
